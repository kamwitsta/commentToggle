commentToggle
=============

Toggles comment for selected lines. If the selection is commented, commentToggle uncomments it; if it’s not commented, commetToggle comments it; if it’s mixed, the above is applied on a per-line basis. Very useful. I know, there are plenty of commenters out there, but this one’s mine. And it’s much simpler. One shortcut (\<Leader\>;) and that’s that.
